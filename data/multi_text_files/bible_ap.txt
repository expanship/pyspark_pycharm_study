Psalms 71:24	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
Psalms 72:1	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
Psalms 72:2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
Psalms 72:3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
Psalms 72:4	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
Psalms 72:5	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
Psalms 72:6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
Psalms 72:7	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
Psalms 72:8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
Psalms 72:9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Psalms 72:10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Psalms 72:11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
Psalms 72:12	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
Psalms 72:13	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
Psalms 72:14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
Psalms 72:15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
Psalms 72:16	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
Psalms 72:17	His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
Psalms 72:18	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
Psalms 72:19	And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
Psalms 72:20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psalms 73:1	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
Psalms 73:2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
Psalms 73:3	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psalms 73:4	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
Psalms 73:5	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
Psalms 73:6	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
Psalms 73:7	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
Psalms 73:8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
Psalms 73:9	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Psalms 73:10	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
Psalms 73:11	And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
Psalms 73:12	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
Psalms 73:13	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
Psalms 73:14	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
Psalms 73:15	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
Psalms 73:16	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
Psalms 73:17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
Psalms 73:18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
Psalms 73:19	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
Psalms 73:20	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
Psalms 73:21	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Psalms 73:22	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
Psalms 73:23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Psalms 73:24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
Psalms 73:25	Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
Psalms 73:26	My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
Psalms 73:27	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
Psalms 73:28	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
Psalms 74:1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Psalms 74:2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Psalms 74:3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
Psalms 74:4	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
Psalms 74:5	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
Psalms 74:6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
Psalms 74:7	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
Psalms 74:8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
Psalms 74:9	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
Psalms 74:10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Psalms 74:11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
Psalms 74:12	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psalms 74:13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Psalms 74:14	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Psalms 74:15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
Psalms 74:16	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Psalms 74:17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Psalms 74:18	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
Psalms 74:19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
Psalms 74:20	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
Psalms 74:21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
Psalms 74:22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
Psalms 74:23	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
Psalms 75:1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
Psalms 75:2	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
Psalms 75:3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
Psalms 75:4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Psalms 75:5	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
Psalms 75:6	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
Psalms 75:7	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
Psalms 75:8	For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
Psalms 75:9	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psalms 75:10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
Psalms 76:1	In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
Psalms 76:2	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
Psalms 76:3	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
Psalms 76:4	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
Psalms 76:5	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
Psalms 76:6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
Psalms 76:7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Psalms 76:8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
Psalms 76:9	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Psalms 76:10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
Psalms 76:11	Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
Psalms 76:12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
Psalms 77:1	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
Psalms 77:2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
Psalms 77:3	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
Psalms 77:4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psalms 77:5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
Psalms 77:6	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
Psalms 77:7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Psalms 77:8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
Psalms 77:9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Psalms 77:10	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psalms 77:11	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psalms 77:12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psalms 77:13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
Psalms 77:14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psalms 77:15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psalms 77:16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psalms 77:17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psalms 77:18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psalms 77:19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psalms 77:20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalms 78:1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalms 78:2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psalms 78:3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psalms 78:4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psalms 78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psalms 78:6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
Psalms 78:7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psalms 78:8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psalms 78:9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms 78:10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psalms 78:11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psalms 78:12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psalms 78:13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psalms 78:14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psalms 78:15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
Psalms 78:16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalms 78:17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psalms 78:18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psalms 78:19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psalms 78:20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psalms 78:21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psalms 78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psalms 78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psalms 78:24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psalms 78:25	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psalms 78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psalms 78:27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psalms 78:28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psalms 78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psalms 78:30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
Psalms 78:31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
Psalms 78:32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psalms 78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psalms 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Psalms 78:35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psalms 78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psalms 78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psalms 78:38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalms 78:39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalms 78:40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
Psalms 78:41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms 78:42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psalms 78:43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
Psalms 78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psalms 78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms 78:46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psalms 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psalms 78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms 78:49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
Psalms 78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psalms 78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psalms 78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms 78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms 78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
Psalms 78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms 78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psalms 78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms 78:59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psalms 78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
Psalms 78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psalms 78:62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalms 78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psalms 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psalms 78:65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psalms 78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms 78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psalms 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms 78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms 78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms 78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalms 79:1	O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psalms 79:2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psalms 79:3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
Psalms 79:4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalms 79:5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms 79:6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psalms 79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psalms 79:8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psalms 79:9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Psalms 79:10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
Psalms 79:11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psalms 79:12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalms 79:13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalms 80:1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
Psalms 80:2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
Psalms 80:3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:4	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Psalms 80:5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Psalms 80:6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psalms 80:7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psalms 80:9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psalms 80:10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
Psalms 80:11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psalms 80:12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psalms 80:13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psalms 80:14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psalms 80:15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms 80:16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psalms 80:17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms 80:18	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psalms 80:19	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psalms 81:1	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Psalms 81:2	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Psalms 81:3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
Psalms 81:4	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
Psalms 81:5	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
Psalms 81:6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
Psalms 81:7	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Psalms 81:8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
Psalms 81:9	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
Psalms 81:10	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
Psalms 81:11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
Psalms 81:12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
Psalms 81:13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
Psalms 81:14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
Psalms 81:15	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
Psalms 81:16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
Psalms 82:1	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psalms 82:2	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Psalms 82:3	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psalms 82:4	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psalms 82:5	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psalms 82:6	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
Psalms 82:7	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psalms 82:8	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
Psalms 83:1	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psalms 83:2	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psalms 83:3	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psalms 83:4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psalms 83:5	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psalms 83:6	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psalms 83:7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psalms 83:8	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
Psalms 83:9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psalms 83:10	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
Psalms 83:11	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psalms 83:12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psalms 83:13	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psalms 83:14	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psalms 83:15	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psalms 83:16	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psalms 83:17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psalms 83:18	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
Psalms 84:1	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psalms 84:2	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Psalms 84:3	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
Psalms 84:4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
Psalms 84:5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
Psalms 84:6	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
Psalms 84:7	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
Psalms 84:8	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

Psalms 102:17	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
Psalms 102:18	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
Psalms 102:19	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
Psalms 102:20	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
Psalms 102:21	To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
Psalms 102:22	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
Psalms 102:23	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
Psalms 102:24	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
Psalms 102:25	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
Psalms 102:26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
Psalms 102:27	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
Psalms 102:28	The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
Psalms 103:1	Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Psalms 103:2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Psalms 103:3	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
Psalms 103:4	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psalms 103:5	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Psalms 103:6	The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
Psalms 103:7	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
Psalms 103:8	The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
Psalms 103:9	He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
Psalms 103:10	He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psalms 103:11	For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
Psalms 103:12	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psalms 103:13	Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
Psalms 103:14	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Psalms 103:15	As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psalms 103:16	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
Psalms 103:17	But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
Psalms 103:18	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
Psalms 103:19	The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
Psalms 103:20	Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Psalms 103:21	Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Psalms 103:22	Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
Psalms 104:1	Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
Psalms 104:2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
Psalms 104:3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
Psalms 104:4	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psalms 104:5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
Psalms 104:6	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
Psalms 104:7	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
Psalms 104:8	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Psalms 104:9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psalms 104:10	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
Psalms 104:11	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psalms 104:12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
Psalms 104:13	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
Psalms 104:14	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
Psalms 104:15	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
Psalms 104:16	The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psalms 104:17	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
Psalms 104:18	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
Psalms 104:19	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
Psalms 104:20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
Psalms 104:21	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
Psalms 104:22	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
Psalms 104:23	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
Psalms 104:24	O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
Psalms 104:25	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
Psalms 104:26	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
Psalms 104:27	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
Psalms 104:28	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Psalms 104:29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psalms 104:30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Psalms 104:31	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
Psalms 104:32	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
Psalms 104:33	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psalms 104:34	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
Psalms 104:35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 105:1	O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Psalms 105:2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Psalms 105:3	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Psalms 105:4	Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psalms 105:5	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
Psalms 105:6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
Psalms 105:7	He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms 105:8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Psalms 105:9	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psalms 105:10	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
Psalms 105:11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
Psalms 105:12	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
Psalms 105:13	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
Psalms 105:14	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
Psalms 105:15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Psalms 105:16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
Psalms 105:17	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
Psalms 105:18	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psalms 105:19	Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
Psalms 105:20	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
Psalms 105:21	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psalms 105:22	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Psalms 105:23	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms 105:24	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Psalms 105:25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
Psalms 105:26	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psalms 105:27	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psalms 105:28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
Psalms 105:29	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psalms 105:30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
Psalms 105:31	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
Psalms 105:32	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
Psalms 105:33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
Psalms 105:34	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
Psalms 105:35	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psalms 105:36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
Psalms 105:37	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
Psalms 105:38	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
Psalms 105:39	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
Psalms 105:40	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psalms 105:41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
Psalms 105:42	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
Psalms 105:43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
Psalms 105:44	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Psalms 105:45	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 106:1	Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psalms 106:2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
Psalms 106:3	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psalms 106:4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psalms 106:5	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psalms 106:6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psalms 106:7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
Psalms 106:8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psalms 106:9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psalms 106:10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms 106:11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psalms 106:12	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psalms 106:13	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psalms 106:14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psalms 106:15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psalms 106:16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psalms 106:17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
Psalms 106:18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psalms 106:19	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psalms 106:20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psalms 106:21	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psalms 106:22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
Psalms 106:23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psalms 106:24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psalms 106:25	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psalms 106:26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psalms 106:27	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psalms 106:28	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psalms 106:29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psalms 106:30	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
Psalms 106:31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psalms 106:32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psalms 106:33	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psalms 106:34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psalms 106:35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psalms 106:36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psalms 106:37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psalms 106:38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms 106:39	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psalms 106:40	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psalms 106:41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psalms 106:42	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psalms 106:43	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psalms 106:44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psalms 106:45	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psalms 106:46	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psalms 106:47	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
Psalms 106:48	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
Psalms 107:1	O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Psalms 107:2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
Psalms 107:3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
Psalms 107:4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Psalms 107:5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psalms 107:6	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Psalms 107:8	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:9	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psalms 107:10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
Psalms 107:11	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Psalms 107:12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
Psalms 107:13	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Psalms 107:15	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:16	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Psalms 107:17	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Psalms 107:18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Psalms 107:19	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:20	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
Psalms 107:21	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
Psalms 107:23	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
Psalms 107:24	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
Psalms 107:25	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
Psalms 107:26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
Psalms 107:27	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
Psalms 107:28	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psalms 107:29	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Psalms 107:30	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psalms 107:31	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms 107:32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
Psalms 107:33	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
Psalms 107:34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psalms 107:35	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
Psalms 107:36	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
Psalms 107:37	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
Psalms 107:38	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psalms 107:39	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
Psalms 107:40	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
Psalms 107:41	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
Psalms 107:42	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Psalms 107:43	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
Psalms 108:1	O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Psalms 108:2	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
Psalms 108:3	I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
Psalms 108:4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Psalms 108:5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
Psalms 108:6	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
Psalms 108:7	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psalms 108:8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
Psalms 108:9	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Psalms 108:10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psalms 108:11	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Psalms 108:12	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Psalms 108:13	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
Psalms 109:1	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
Psalms 109:2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psalms 109:3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Psalms 109:4	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
Psalms 109:5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psalms 109:6	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
Psalms 109:7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Psalms 109:8	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
Psalms 109:9	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Psalms 109:10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
Psalms 109:11	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Psalms 109:12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Psalms 109:13	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Psalms 109:14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psalms 109:15	Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Psalms 109:16	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
Psalms 109:17	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psalms 109:18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Psalms 109:19	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psalms 109:20	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
Psalms 109:21	But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
Psalms 109:22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psalms 109:23	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
Psalms 109:24	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
Psalms 109:25	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Psalms 109:26	Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
Psalms 109:27	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
Psalms 109:28	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Psalms 109:29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
Psalms 109:30	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
Psalms 109:31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
Psalms 110:1	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Psalms 110:2	The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Psalms 110:3	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Psalms 110:4	The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
Psalms 110:5	The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
Psalms 110:6	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
Psalms 110:7	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
Psalms 111:1	Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
Psalms 111:2	The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
Psalms 111:3	His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psalms 111:4	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
Psalms 111:5	He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
Psalms 111:6	He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
Psalms 111:7	The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
Psalms 111:8	They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
Psalms 111:9	He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
Psalms 111:10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
Psalms 112:1	Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
Psalms 112:2	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
