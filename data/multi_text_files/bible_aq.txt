Proverbs 1:1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
Proverbs 1:2	To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
Proverbs 1:3	To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
Proverbs 1:4	To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
Proverbs 1:5	A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
Proverbs 1:6	To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Proverbs 1:7	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs 1:8	My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs 1:9	For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
Proverbs 1:10	My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
Proverbs 1:11	If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
Proverbs 1:12	Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
Proverbs 1:13	We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
Proverbs 1:14	Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
Proverbs 1:15	My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
Proverbs 1:16	For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs 1:17	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
Proverbs 1:18	And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
Proverbs 1:19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Proverbs 1:20	Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
Proverbs 1:21	She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
Proverbs 1:22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs 1:23	Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
Proverbs 1:24	Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
Proverbs 1:25	But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
Proverbs 1:26	I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
Proverbs 1:27	When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
Proverbs 1:28	Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
Proverbs 1:29	For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
Proverbs 1:30	They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Proverbs 1:31	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
Proverbs 1:32	For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
Proverbs 1:33	But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
Proverbs 2:1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
Proverbs 2:2	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
Proverbs 2:3	Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
Proverbs 2:4	If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
Proverbs 2:5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs 2:6	For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
Proverbs 2:7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
Proverbs 2:8	He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
Proverbs 2:9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
Proverbs 2:10	When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
Proverbs 2:11	Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
Proverbs 2:12	To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
Proverbs 2:13	Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs 2:14	Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
Proverbs 2:15	Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
Proverbs 2:16	To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
Proverbs 2:17	Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
Proverbs 2:18	For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
Proverbs 2:19	None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
Proverbs 2:20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs 2:21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
Proverbs 2:22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
Proverbs 3:1	My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
Proverbs 3:2	For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
Proverbs 3:3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
Proverbs 3:4	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Proverbs 3:5	Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
Proverbs 3:6	In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Proverbs 3:7	Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
Proverbs 3:8	It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
Proverbs 3:9	Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
Proverbs 3:10	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
Proverbs 3:11	My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
Proverbs 3:12	For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Proverbs 3:13	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
Proverbs 3:14	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
Proverbs 3:15	She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Proverbs 3:16	Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
Proverbs 3:17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
Proverbs 3:18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
Proverbs 3:19	The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
Proverbs 3:20	By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
Proverbs 3:21	My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Proverbs 3:22	So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
Proverbs 3:23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
Proverbs 3:24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Proverbs 3:25	Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
Proverbs 3:26	For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
Proverbs 3:27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
Proverbs 3:28	Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
Proverbs 3:29	Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Proverbs 3:30	Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Proverbs 3:31	Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.|
Proverbs 3:32	For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
Proverbs 3:33	The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
Proverbs 3:34	Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Proverbs 3:35	The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Proverbs 4:1	Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
Proverbs 4:2	For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
Proverbs 4:3	For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Proverbs 4:4	He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Proverbs 4:5	Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 4:6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
Proverbs 4:7	Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
Proverbs 4:8	Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
Proverbs 4:9	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
Proverbs 4:10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
Proverbs 4:11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
Proverbs 4:12	When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Proverbs 4:13	Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
Proverbs 4:14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
Proverbs 4:15	Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
Proverbs 4:16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Proverbs 4:17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs 4:18	But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Proverbs 4:19	The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
Proverbs 4:20	My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Proverbs 4:21	Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
Proverbs 4:22	For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Proverbs 4:23	Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
Proverbs 4:24	Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
Proverbs 4:25	Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Proverbs 4:26	Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
Proverbs 4:27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
Proverbs 5:1	My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
Proverbs 5:2	That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Proverbs 5:3	For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs 5:4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs 5:5	Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
Proverbs 5:6	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
Proverbs 5:7	Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 5:8	Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
Proverbs 5:9	Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
Proverbs 5:10	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
Proverbs 5:11	And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Proverbs 5:12	And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
Proverbs 5:13	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Proverbs 5:14	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Proverbs 5:15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
Proverbs 5:16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
Proverbs 5:17	Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
Proverbs 5:18	Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
Proverbs 5:19	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
Proverbs 5:20	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
Proverbs 5:21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
Proverbs 5:22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
Proverbs 5:23	He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Proverbs 6:1	My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
Proverbs 6:2	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Proverbs 6:3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
Proverbs 6:4	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
Proverbs 6:5	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs 6:6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
Proverbs 6:7	Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
Proverbs 6:8	Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
Proverbs 6:9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Proverbs 6:10	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
Proverbs 6:11	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
Proverbs 6:12	A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
Proverbs 6:13	He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
Proverbs 6:14	Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
Proverbs 6:15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
Proverbs 6:16	These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
Proverbs 6:17	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
Proverbs 6:18	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
Proverbs 6:19	A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
Proverbs 6:20	My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs 6:21	Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
Proverbs 6:22	When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Proverbs 6:23	For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Proverbs 6:24	To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Proverbs 6:25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Proverbs 6:26	For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

Proverbs 6:33	A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Proverbs 6:34	For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Proverbs 6:35	He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
Proverbs 7:1	My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

Proverbs 7:4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
Proverbs 7:5	That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
Proverbs 7:6	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
Proverbs 7:7	And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
Proverbs 7:8	Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
Proverbs 7:9	In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
Proverbs 7:10	And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
Proverbs 7:11	(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
Proverbs 7:12	Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
Proverbs 7:13	So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
Proverbs 7:14	I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
Proverbs 7:15	Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Proverbs 7:16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
Proverbs 7:17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs 7:18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
Proverbs 7:19	For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
Proverbs 7:20	He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
Proverbs 7:21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
Proverbs 7:22	He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
Proverbs 7:23	Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
Proverbs 7:24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 7:25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
Proverbs 7:26	For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
Proverbs 7:27	Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Proverbs 8:1	Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

Proverbs 8:26	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
Proverbs 8:27	When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
Proverbs 8:28	When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
Proverbs 8:29	When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
Proverbs 8:30	Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
Proverbs 8:31	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
Proverbs 8:32	Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
Proverbs 8:33	Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Proverbs 8:34	Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

Proverbs 9:16	Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
